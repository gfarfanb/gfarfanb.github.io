*Although documenting can be boring, some of the actual engineering ideas have 
transcended despite time, because someone retakes the concept.*

If you require a plumber service, you are not looking for an owner of a plumbing big
toolbox but plumbing skills. It is the same for developers, so why we spent a lot of 
time learning new technologies or new concepts? Because new things generate new ideas 
and of course new development disasters because of new types of implementation and as 
result, more experience.

## Big picture

In order to know about my current developer status, I made a big picture of the tools 
that I had used. The first question for me is, Where is the evidence for that? I do 
not know because I had used all of these technologies, I had solved a lot of troubles, 
but I have not captured anything, grave mistake. I do not know the real cost in time 
about building something, I do not remember all code syntax for all technologies listed, 
I do not have any tangible example of my working, in summary, I depend absolutely on a 
search engine (such as Google) even for my own implementations.

The image above shows not my toolbox but "read" technologies. Why? because I do not have
 any resource made by me. For sure when I require applying that knowledge, I am going to 
 spend the same time in both searchings any past own solutions or making new ones. So, 
 the time that I can use for researching or testing new things I am going to use it in 
 searching old forgotten solved stuff, this is not a good practice.

## Make an own knowledge base

Actually, exist a lot of services to build a robust knowledge base and this will be 
my next step: *capture all my current developer experience*. No business concepts, 
only reusable ideas, as resources. The goal is simple, convert from volatile
knowledge to concrete knowledge. Therefore, this is my first perspective of what 
and where capture my experience in a shareable and available place.

Service | Possible content
------- | ----------------
[GitHub](https://github.com/) | Projects, Issues tracking, *Knowledge cartridge*
[Gist GitHub](https://gist.github.com/) | Example, Practices, Experiments, Findings, Compilations, *Knowledge units*
[Personal blog](https://gfarfanb.github.io/) | Articles, Posts, Notes, Experiences, *Knowledge notes*
[GitBooks](https://www.gitbook.com/) | Books, Manuals, API, Knowledge base, *Knowledge references*
[Trello](https://trello.com/) | Activities, Progress tracking, Time tracking ([Timeneye extension](https://www.timeneye.com/en/home/)), *Knowledge tracking*

For each service you can find a knowledge concept: cartridge, unit, note, reference 
and tracking. Let me explain what each one means.

**Knowledge cartridge**
: Showcase of any idea, how it works and how to get started. All requirements
for working are mandatory.

**Knowledge unit**
: Grain-fine pieces of work. Grouped by tags with a specific description. 
Each piece must be understandable by perception and intuition not by 
searching in depth.

**Knowledge note**
: Annotations, conclusions, and discussions about any idea, contributions
or step-by-step implementations.

**Knowledge reference**
: Official documentation.

**Knowledge tracking**
: Measurable activity log. 

## Conclusion

This post shows me the reality about my status as a developer and I could 
save time using my own experience instead of spending it on searching. Also, 
it could be a good way to share my knowledge. Since I already defined my points 
of improvements, the next tasks could be to translate all my recovered knowledge 
as knowledge component (such as mentioned previously). If this works I will be 
able to define an overview on my developer way.

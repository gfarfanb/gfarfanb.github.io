*"Be willing to part with some insistence, then freedom comes"*

During my first job, I received a cup as present from my manager with that phrase. Maybe she picked 
it randomly but cause a big impact in my next decisions, Am I following the correct path to 
becoming a developer?

I had a little bit worth development repertory, I had created two or more production projects 
from drafts, I tried to share knowledge using a design pattern template based blog but I did not feel
as a developer yet.

## Developer paths references

So, in the searching of my developer way, I found an interesting [developer roadmap](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap)
where you can pick one of the three paths: Front-End, Back-End, and DevOps. Whatever you want you firstly
need to have some basics topics: Git (or any related), SSH, HTTP/HTTPS, APIs, basic terminal usage, 
research skills, data structures and algorithms, character encodings and GitHub (or any related). 
Do not worry this is just the beginning.

After picking any roadmap you need to dominate a large list of technologies, for example, for Back-End
Roadmap you need to know any tool for package management, frameworks, testing, debugging and profiling,
web servers, authentication, containers, storage, search engine and API management. Plus to the previous list
you need to know about... wait! more? yes, more, Does not make sense? 

Actually exists a lot of references about [every programmer should know](https://github.com/mr-mig/every-programmer-should-know),
or about [software developer skills](https://simpleprogrammer.com/2016/07/18/technical-skills-software-developer/),
or ideas for a [path to becoming a software developer](https://simpleprogrammer.com/2014/06/30/step-step-path-becoming-great-software-developer/).
In fact, you need to figure out what kind of developer would you like to be, take a developer path template, 
study hard, implement all knowledge acquired and share awesome material to the developer communities. 
You guessed it! This is my personal challenge and the objective of this blog. 

## Blog as a Channel

You will find here all my personal notes, conclusions, trenches experiences, discoveries, practices, sharable 
code solutions and everything I learned as success or failure evidence of how I become an elite developer. 

The main idea is share, as a logger, the step-by-step of my developer transition trace. Maybe any part of this process
is useful for you, maybe you can identify a pattern that helps you to figure out your own way, or maybe you are slapping 
your keyboard until finding a solution without result and casually I wrote about that, whatever the case feel free to 
use or enrich or discuss about this blog. 

### TODO list

The whole blog content can be summarized in the next TODO list:

- [ ] Figure out my current developer status
- [ ] Customize developer career roadmap
- [ ] Take new technologies challenges
- [ ] Ace my jobs
- [ ] Develop an almost "silver bullet" project
- [ ] Become the greatest developer ever
- [ ] Take over the world

I accept it, sounds very exaggerated but writing things like these makes me feel excited, capable, with the 
motivation needed to try it. So, I hope you enjoy this blog and welcome.

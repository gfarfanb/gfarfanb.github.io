*"Our job is not to write code. That is the easy part. Our job is to make decisions."* [@jessitron](https://twitter.com/jessitron)

You cannot do a sizing of your \skills but quantity of your repertory

You do not accept someone for \their toolbox but for \their experience

It is not to have a large tech repertory but experience, in fact if you look for a job you need to match with specific tech stach and IT hunters highlight, you have a plus if you know something else.

So, what happen with my perspective tech approach does not help me to seem a good developer and on the other hand (transform to tech knowledge into resources)

Jira, Confluence, BitBucket, Redmine

Do not do programming difficult, shape your code into resource

If you require a plumber service, you are not looking for an owner of a plumbing big
toolbox but plumbing skills. It is the same for developers, so why we spent a lot of 
time learning new technologies or new concepts? Because new things generate new ideas 
and of course new development disasters because of new types of implementation and as 
result, more experience.

In order to know about my current developer status I made a big picture of the things 
that I had used. An the first question for me is, Where is the evidence for that? 
I do not know, because I had used all of these technologies, I had solved a lot of 
troubles, but I have not captured nothing, grave mistake. I do not know the real
cost in time about building something, I do not remember all code syntax for all 
technologies listed, I do not have any tangible example of something working, in summary
I depend absolutely in Google even for my own implementation.

The image above shows not my toolbox but technologies "readed". Why? because I do 
not have any resource made by me and maybe I am goint to spend the same time in both 
searching any past own solutions or making a new ones. So, the time that I can use for 
researching or testing new things I am going to use it in searching old forgotten 
solved stuff, this is not a good practice.

## Make an own knowledge base

In order to become a great develop I need to focus on new thing, but for not worry
about history, it is neccesary to change the strategy. I am not going to depend 
only in my memory but in an own knowledge base. Actually exist a lot of services
to build a robust knowledge base and this will be my next task: capture as resource
all my current developer experience, no business concepts, only reusable ideas 
prefereably as code or found ideas from interesting authors. The idea is simple,
avoiding searching from zero knowledge adquired in some moment. I am not making 
the wheel, I only need to put all my knowledge in some shareable and available
place.

This is my first perspective of what and where capture my knowledge:

| Service | Possible content  |
|:------- | -----------------:|
| [GitHub](https://github.com/) | Projects, Issues tracking, *Knowledge cartridge* |
| [Gist GitHub](https://gist.github.com/) | Example, Practices, Experiments, Findings, Compilations, *Knowledge units* |
| [Personal blog](https://gfarfanb.github.io/) | Articles, Posts, Notes, Experiences, *Knowledge notes* |
| [GitBooks](https://www.gitbook.com/) | Books, Manuals, API, Knowledge base, *Knowledge references* |
| [Trello](https://trello.com/) | Activities, Progress tracking, Time tracking ([Timeneye extension](https://www.timeneye.com/en/home/)) |

Of course a format is required, because it is impossible to migrate any if you cannot
figure out how is structured. 

## Next steps

It is neccesary to configure once...

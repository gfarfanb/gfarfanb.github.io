I want you to enjoy your stay here as much as possible and to do so, please abide by these guidelines. I don't 
know about you, but I know how I expect you and people to behave when visiting this site. That's why I reserve
the right to delete comments and ban users as needed to keep the comment threads here civil and substantive.

**Don't be a jerk**
: I will not tolerate any name-calling, personal attacks or harassment of any kind. Racism, bigotry, misogyny 
or any other inappropriate responses will be removed.

**Absolutely NO drama!**
: Do not bring drama from a different channel onto this one. Personal attacks against a mod will not be tolerated. 
Do not pursue an argument with a mod from another channel they mod to this one.

**Stay on topic**
: If your post does not address the article or relate to it in some context, you will be asked to take your 
conversation to the community and your post deleted.

**No self-promotion**
: So you’ve got a climate change solution that will simultaneously solve world poverty. Great. Send it through 
my [contact form]({{ site.github.url }}/contact.html). A discussion or comment that contains only a link to 
your blog, a product, or your article on another site will almost always be removed.

**No trolling**
: If you post a deliberately offensive or provocative comment with the aim of upsetting someone or eliciting an 
angry response from them, your post will be deleted. Continue the behavior and you'll be asked to leave.

**No stalking**
: If you follow someone to this channel to continue an argument you've had with them on another or to harass them, 
your post will be deleted. Continue the behavior and you will be asked to leave.

**No sock puppets**
: If you try to circumvent a ban by returning with a sock puppet or new account, you will earn an instant ban; 
no warning needed.

**No serial flagging**
: Flagging is to be done only if the commenter has violated the [Disqus Terms of Service](https://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/466260-terms-of-service), contains spam or 
offensive language. Flagging simply because you don't agree with someone is unacceptable.

**Don’t copy and paste**
: If you didn’t write it or haven’t properly cited the article you’re quoting, don’t post it.
